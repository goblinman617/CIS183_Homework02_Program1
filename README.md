 RBG Background Color Slider

This program has 3 slider bars that control the RGB value of the background and text displays those values and the hexadecimal value. There is a button to save the current color set by the sliders. If you click any color in the list the background will change and the sliders written values will change. 

One issue that I ran into while making this was that if I set the background of the app manually in the XML editor. I wouldnt be able to change the background later. I had to set the background to white in the code to get around this. The reason why I had to set the background to white is because on my phone the app opened with a black background because it's in darkmode. Also, Despite taking up the whole area below the button, my phone cuts off the top and bottom of my list view.
